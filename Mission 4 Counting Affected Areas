You believe that knowing how often each of the areas of the Atlantic are affected by these strong hurricanes is important for making preparations for future hurricanes.

Write a function that counts how often each area is listed as an affected area of a hurricane. Store and return the results in a dictionary where the keys are the affected areas and the values are counts of how many times the areas were affected.

Test your function on your hurricane dictionary.

            for y in hurricanes[i]['Area Affected']: #Loop 체ber die einzelnen Eintr채ge auf Areas Affected
                if y not in affected_areas_count:
                    affected_areas_count[y] = 1
                else:
